Files in ClientServerShared folder are meant to be shared (compile time)
between client and server (web api) projects. 

Namespace is simply ClientServerShared since it's used in both client and server projects.

To handle versioning, a version property could be defined in request/response 
for various client versions and the request/response will be properly handled 
on client/server side.
