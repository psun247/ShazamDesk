==Overview
Shazam is a popular mobile app that can identify a song being played. This C# WPF app does something like that. Plus, it calls a lyrics web service to try to get lyrics for the identified song. It can save song info in Azure SQL DB via Web API or in local SQL Server DB.

==ShazamCore project
Core class library that contains Azure AD authentication logic, services, models, helpers, etc.  It is use by WpfShazam and WinUI3Shazam UI projects.

==ShazamCore's major folders
Services - each service (used by MainViewModel) supports one aspect of the app

AzureADClientSecret - Azure AD bear token authentication stuff (JWT token)

Data / Migrations - Code First DbContext for SQL Server + Entity Framework

ClientServerShared - requests and responses for Web API, DTOs, constants, and so on, shared between client and server projects

==WpfShazam project
WPF Shazam UI project that references ShazamCore project.  It contains all the views and view models (MainViewModel - one partial class per tab, e.g. MainViewModel.Azure.cs).

==Shazam tab
Listen to a device (mic or speaker) selected from the dropdown list.  When identified, a list of songs will be displayed，plus lyrics (if found) will be shown on the right side of the screen.  Usually, you could select a song from the list to save it with the lyrics in Azure SQL DB (via Web API) or SQL Server DB.

You can open currently selected YouTube video externally with default web browser.

==Azure tab
Saved song info list in Azure SQL DB (via Web API) will be displayed in the left panel. When an item is selected in the list, the matching YouTube video will display on the right side.

You can delete a selected item in the list via Web API.

==SQL Server tab
Similar to Azure tab, but data store is a local SQL Server DB.  Note: SQL Server needs to be installed and configured properly, and connection string change in SqlServerContext.cs will be required.

Since SQL Server is assumed not installed, default mode on this tab is Demo that shows a predefined read-only list.

==About tab
It is this tab with a RichTextBox containing a FlowDocument with Paragraphs built programmatically.
